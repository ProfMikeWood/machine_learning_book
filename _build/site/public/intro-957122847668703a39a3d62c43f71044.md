# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to an Introduction to Machine Learning!

## About This Book

The materials in this "book" originated from course notes in the **CS 171 Introduction to Machine Learning** course at San José State University and I am slowly posting and updating them for a graduate-level **MS 285 Machine Learning Application in Marine Science** seminar course at the Moss Landing Marine Labs. Most of the examples are related to marine science, oceanography, climate science, or related fields.

These notes are intended to be an introduction to core topics in machine learning and a guide for students and researchers in both computer science and marine science. PyTorch is the primary computational tool used to illustrate models and workflows because it is flexibile and used widely in research. However, there are many examples that used regular computational tools like `numpy` and `scipy` and a few selected examples also use scikit-learn.
